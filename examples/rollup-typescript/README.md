# rollup-typescript

> This example was scaffolded from the official [Svelte TypeScript template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).

In version 10.15.1, [TypeScript definitions](../../types/index.d.ts) were added for `carbon-pictograms-svelte` in an attempt to stub the interface (i.e. props) of Pictogram components.

Assuming that you use VSCode and have the offical [Svelte VSCode extension](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/svelte-vscode) installed, you should experience some level of code completion for pictogram imports and props.
